# Flexbox
Messing around with Flexbox
Have multiple containers because that's how it came out and it seemed easier to keep them all instead of redoing everything, if needed
The sizing seems fine on my monitor when resizing the window, haven't tried mobile though
My header/nav could definitely be better but its functionable at the moment
The text in the center of the image was a pain and I couldn't get it to look that good so I kept that part out
